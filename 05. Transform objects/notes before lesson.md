There are 4 types of properties to transfrom objects:
- position
- scale 
- rotation
- quaternion

// if you open the PerspectiveCamera documentation: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera 

// you will see that the PerspectiveCamera inherits from the Camera class and the Camera class inherits from the Object3D class.

- All these inherit from object 3d

- These properties will be compiled in the matrices.
